# Arrays

This code explores arrays. It also uses a new node module called chalk that allows you to have output in different colors.  The code shows some basic ways to manipulate arrays.  The final project asks the user to type in a number and stores the numbers until the user quits.  Then the program sums all the numbers that were entered.
